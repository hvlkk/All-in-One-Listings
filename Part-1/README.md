# All in One Listings - Part One

## Description

In this part of the project, we were tasked with incrementally designing a webpage that featured dummy ad listings, which were created based on existing advertisements. The development process was structured into five exercises, each building on the previous one to gradually enhance the webpage's structure, styling, and functionality.

Brief descriptions of the 5 exercises of the directory follow:

- Exercise 1: Conceptual design of the webpage with HTML.
- Exercise 2: Early, simplistic CSS.
- Exercise 3: Flex and grid utilisation for higher quality styling.
- Exercise 4: Responsive design, through the use of media queries and responsive images.
- Exercise 5: Forms and user input validation.
