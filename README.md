# All in One Listings

## Description

This repository hosts the two-part project we developed as part of AUEB's "Technologies and Programming of Web Applications" (INF165 - 3747) course, offered during the winter semester of 2023-24. The project required building a webpage for ad listings.

The first part of the project involved building a responsive webpage using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, developed incrementally over the course of five exercises. The second part of the project involved creating a full-stack web application, which fetched and worked with data provided by an external API. The backend was built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, while the frontend used HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with Handlebars.js employed for dynamic HTML generation.

More information regarding each part can be found in the respective directories.
